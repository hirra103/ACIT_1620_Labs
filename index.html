        <p>
            Artistic, adventurous, and caring are words I would use to describe myself. 
            I am 19 years old, and the oldest of 4 siblings. 
            I would say my <em>favourite</em> colour is probably a nice light grey at the moment. 
            I used to <strong> love </strong> blue, but as I've gotten older, I don't find the same beauty in it as I once did. 
            Currently, I am a student at BCIT. <br> <a href='https://www.bcit.ca/study/?utm_source=search&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand&utm_content=prospecting&gclid=Cj0KCQiAgomBBhDXARIsAFNyUqP2qyjwuKttuPYfuda9oMwkBl1tIET3FwJE0QbVxWjRX6ozyP48J10aAo0pEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds'>
