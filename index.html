                Artistic, adventurous, and caring are words I would use to describe myself. 
                I am 19 years old, and the oldest of 4 siblings. 
                I would say my <em>favourite</em> colour is probably a nice light grey at the moment. 
                I used to <strong> love </strong> blue, but as I've gotten older, I don't find the same beauty in it as I once did. 
                Currently, I am a student at BCIT.

            This is the second paragraph about me, in which I am going to write the same things as before :) I am 19 years old, and the oldest of 4 siblings. 
            I would say my <em>favourite</em> colour is probably a nice light grey at the moment.
